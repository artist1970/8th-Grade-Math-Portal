🚀 8th Grade Math Portal: “Cosmic Math Mission”
🌌 Core Overview

A web-based interactive learning hub designed to guide 8th graders through a 42-week math adventure covering:

Pre-Algebra

Algebra I

Geometry

Probability & Statistics

Problem Solving / Logic

Each week represents a “mission” in the deep-space journey — students unlock new challenges, track progress, and earn badges for mastery.

💻 Technical Build Plan

We can build it in phases, all vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Wix-compatible if needed):

Phase 1:

Interface design (main dashboard, color theme selector, deep-space animation)

Phase 2:

Core daily lesson system (load problems dynamically)

Phase 3:

Gradebook + progress tracking

Phase 4:

Teacher/Admin panel + theme customization

Phase 5:

Audio/voice integration and interactive “Assist” AI helper
